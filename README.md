# Deep Learning Project
  
## The Data

We choose to analyse IBM history stock data which include about 13K records from the last 50 years.  
Each record contains:  
- Open price  
- Close price  
- High Price  
- Low price  
- Volume  
- Adjacent close price  
- Date  

The main challenges of this project is to actually find some interesting features, that will give accurate prediction.  
This project is interesting because as everybody knows deep learning solved tasks that considered difficult in the part even with pretty basic deep learning features.  
and if we find something it can be used to make a lot of money.
